## RuPaw's Cute Race
If don't find yourself cute, how the hell are you gonna find anyone else cute?

## Install

```
yarn
yarn knex migrate:latest
yarn knex seed:run
yarn dev
```

## Getting Started
  There are a few example files, like a words.js reducer and a Words database table migration and seeds. These are all for reference only!

  Front-end: you will need to clear the words.js reducer.
  Back-end: you will need to delete the Words migration and seed, and replace with a new, more relevant one. Routes and database functions will also change.
